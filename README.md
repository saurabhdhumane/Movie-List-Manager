# Movie List Manager

- The Movie List Manager is a JavaScript project that allows users to create and manage a list of movies. The web application comprises a form where users can add new movies to the list, and the movie list is displayed on the web page using HTML and CSS. Users can delete movies from the list by clicking on the "delete" button next to each movie, or they can edit the movie name by clicking on an "edit" button.

## Functionality
- The project uses event listeners to capture user actions such as adding or deleting movies and updates the movie list accordingly. When a user adds or edits a movie, the movie list is stored in cookies to ensure that it can be retrieved and displayed the next time the user visits the web page. The use of cookies allows users to persist their movie lists even after they close the browser or shut down their devices.

- The Movie List Manager uses DOM manipulation techniques to add, remove, and update HTML elements on the web page dynamically. This approach ensures that the web application responds to user actions in real-time, providing a smooth and seamless user experience. Additionally, the project demonstrates how regular expressions can be used to extract data from cookies.


## Usage
- To use the Movie List Manager, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The movie list can be updated by adding or deleting movies using the form on the web page. The movie list is automatically stored in cookies, so it will be available the next time the user visits the web page.
